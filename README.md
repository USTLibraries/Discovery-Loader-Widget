# Discovery-Widget
Generate a search box for your library discovery layer. Currently available for Summon but additional services/customizations may be added.

Be sure to change static.stthomas.edu/libraries to point to your own code
Also be sure to change instances of stthomas.summon.serialssolutions.com

## Summon Search

Use the summon.js and summon.css files

## Primo Search

New! Now Primo Search boxes are supported.
Just use primo.js and primo.css files
Uses the same DIV tag structure as before so switching to Primo from Summon (or vice versa) is easy! (More documentation coming soon)
