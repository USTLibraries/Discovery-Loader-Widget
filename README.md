# Discovery-Widget
Generate a search box for your library discovery layer. Currently available for Summon and Primo but additional services/customizations may be added. Just look at the primo.js and summon.js and see how they differ and generate to learn how.

## Get Started

1. Use a DIV tag from one of the example HTML files.
2. Customize the custom variables in the .js files.
3. Then add a call to the [summon/primo].js file.
4. CSS will be included automatically! But if you wish to load the css into a main css file, go ahead (it checks so it won't do it twice!)

## Summon Search

Use the summon.js and summon.css files

## Primo Search

New! May 2017! Now Primo Search boxes are supported!

Just use primo.js and primo.css files

Uses the same DIV tag structure as before so switching to Primo from Summon (or vice versa) is easy! (More documentation coming soon)
